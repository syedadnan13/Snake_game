# Snake_game
This GitHub repository contains the full source code for a Snake game created using the raylib game development library. The game is programmed in the C++ programming language and uses various raylib functions for graphics, input handling, and audio. 
# Overview 
The Retro Snake Game is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the raylib library. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own tail. The game features a score display and a game over screen that allows the player to restart the game.  
# Features  
1. Snake Movement: Control the snake using the arrow keys.  
2. Food Collection: Eat food to grow the snake and increase the score.  
3. Game Over Screen: Displays the final score and allows the player to restart the game.  
4. Dynamic Gameplay: The snake grows longer with each piece of food collected.
# Requirements
1. raylib: Make sure to have the raylib library installed. You can find installation instructions on the raylib GitHub page.  
2. C++ Compiler: A C++ compiler such as GCC or Clang.
# Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.  
2. Ensure that raylib is installed and properly linked in your development environment.  
3. Place the food image (food.png) in a folder named Graphics and the sound files (eat.mp3 and wall.mp3) in a folder named Sounds.
# Controls
1. Arrow Keys: Control the direction of the snake.  
2. Spacebar: Restart the game after a game over.  
# Game Logic
1. The snake starts with a length of three segments and moves in a specified direction.  
2. When the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the score increases.  
3. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself, displaying the final score and a prompt to restart.
